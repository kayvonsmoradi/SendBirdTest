# SendBirdTest
Created with CodeSandbox

This repo presents task #2 from the take-home assignment for the position over at SendBird.

Unfortunately, I was not able to create the web notification via FireBase. The following errors are what prevented me from accomplishing task #2:

The code from the instructions - " navigator.serviceWorker.register(new URL('../firebase-messaging-sw.js', import.meta.url), {type: 'module'})" provided an error in which I was not able to fix.
I was able to get my key from FireBase and plug it into the cloud essaging section of SendBird, but no token was able to authorize for me. I had limited resources at my disposable since I had to return my computer, but I did try to send an API for device registration through PostMan online but it kept failing with a 500 error that I was not able to fix.
